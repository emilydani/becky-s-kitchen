            Let me take the stress out of your lunch party and create a tasty lunch menuâ€”catered directly to your wants and needs. Along with offering lunch items like sandwiches, soups and salads, and fruit and veggie platers, anything on the dinner menu can be made for lunch. If something catches your eye, give me a call and we can discuss details.
